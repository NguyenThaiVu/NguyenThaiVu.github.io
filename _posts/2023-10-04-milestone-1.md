## 5. Simple Visualizations

### Question 1: Comparing Shot Types
I chose the 2016 season (including both the regular season and playoffs) to produce a figure that compares shot types across all teams. In analyzing the data, it becomes clear that the most dangerous type of shot is the "deflected" shot, with the highest goal percentage of 19.8%. This suggests that deflected shots have a significantly higher chance of resulting in a goal compared to other shot types.
On the other hand, the most common type of shot is the "wrist shot," as indicated by the highest bar in the histogram. The reason I chose this figure is that it provides a straightforward visual representation of the shot and goal counts for each shot type, allowing us to easily compare their quantities and ratios. It's a valuable tool for understanding which shot types are both frequent and effective in scoring goals.

### Question 2: Relationship between Shot Distance and Goal Chance
In general, in ice hockey matches, the closer the shot distance to the goal, the higher the probability of scoring. This is because, when closer to the goal, the goalkeeper's defensive range is smaller, giving the shooting player a better chance to put the puck into the net. As seen in my chart, it's evident that the probability of scoring is significantly higher for shot distances less than 10 feet compared to shot distances greater than 10 feet. This trend remained consistent across the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. I chose to use a lineplot graph because it allows for a direct visualization of how the goal-scoring probability changes with varying shot distances.

### Question 3: Goal Percentage by Shot Distance and Type
To create a figure that shows the goal percentage as a function of both distance from the net and the category of shot types for a single season, we can use a heatmap. 
The x-axis can represent shot distances, the y-axis can represent shot types, and the color intensity can represent the goal percentage.
In our blog post, we can discuss the findings from the heatmap, identifying the most dangerous types of shots based on goal percentage at different distances from the net.

## 6.Advanced visualization

### Question 1. Export html plot 
- The shot map visualization are stored [here](/Image/Advanced_visualization/shot_map_visualization.html)

### Question 2. Discusss from shot map
- The main idea here is to measure the frequency of shots from specific positions for each team compared to the league average. This measure helps highlight areas where a team may be particularly strong or weak compared to the average league.
- For example, if Team A has a higher shot rate in front of the net, it suggests that Team A is likely to take shots at close range compared to the average league.

### Question 3. Discuss about the team *Colorado Avalanche*
- In season 2016-2017, the Colorado Avalanche had dark blue in front of the net, which means that this team took fewer shots compared to the average league. We can assume that the forwards of this team are bad at the shot. As a result, this team final at the lowest ranking of the league.

- In season 2020-2021, the Colorado Avalanche have a dark red in the middle of the offensive zone, which mean that this team takes a lot of shot. In other words, the forwards of this team are good at controlling the match and shot. Finally, this team takes the highest position in the standings.

- The analysis and final results make sense.

### Question 4. Comparision between *Buffalo Sabres* and *Tampa Bay Lightning*
- *Buffalo Sabres*:
    + From the 2018-2020 seasons, this team had a dark blue area in front of the net. This means that this team can not approach the opponent's goal and take a shot. 
    + Although the Buffalo Sabres have some dark red area in the map (in the year 2018-2019), it is far from the net. It is a long-range shot, which is not really an effective strategy.

- *Tampa Bay Lightning*:
    + This team had a dark red area in front of the net during 2018-2020. This means that this team control the match and take a lot of shot to the opponent's net.
