Simple Visualizations

Question 1:

Comparing Shot Types
I chose the 2016 season (including both the regular season and playoffs) to produce a figure that compares shot types across all teams. In analyzing the data, it becomes clear that the most dangerous type of shot is the "deflected" shot, with the highest goal percentage of 19.8%. This suggests that deflected shots have a significantly higher chance of resulting in a goal compared to other shot types.

On the other hand, the most common type of shot is the "wrist shot," as indicated by the highest bar in the histogram. The reason I chose this figure is that it provides a straightforward visual representation of the shot and goal counts for each shot type, allowing us to easily compare their quantities and ratios. It's a valuable tool for understanding which shot types are both frequent and effective in scoring goals.

Question 2: 

Relationship between Shot Distance and Goal Chance
In general, in ice hockey matches, the closer the shot distance to the goal, the higher the probability of scoring. This is because, when closer to the goal, the goalkeeper's defensive range is smaller, giving the shooting player a better chance to put the puck into the net. As seen in my chart, it's evident that the probability of scoring is significantly higher for shot distances less than 10 feet compared to shot distances greater than 10 feet. This trend remained consistent across the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. I chose to use a lineplot graph because it allows for a direct visualization of how the goal-scoring probability changes with varying shot distances.

Question 3: Goal Percentage by Shot Distance and Type
To create a figure that shows the goal percentage as a function of both distance from the net and the category of shot types for a single season, we can use a heatmap. 
The x-axis can represent shot distances, the y-axis can represent shot types, and the color intensity can represent the goal percentage.
In our blog post, we can discuss the findings from the heatmap, identifying the most dangerous types of shots based on goal percentage at different distances from the net.
