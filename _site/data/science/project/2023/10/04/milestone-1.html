<h2 id="2-guide-to-interactive-nhl-game-data-panel">2. Guide to Interactive NHL Game Data Panel</h2>

<p>In this guide, we’ll explore how to use an interactive Python script to access and visualize NHL game data. The script includes graphical user interface elements to select, view, and plot game from NHL data.</p>

<!-- 
### 2.1 Using the Interactive Panel

The interactive panel allows you to explore NHL game data in a user-friendly manner. Let's break down how to use each part of the code:

#### Importing Necessary Libraries and Modules

This block imports essential Python modules, such as IPython widgets for creating the GUI, Matplotlib for data visualization, Pillow for image manipulation, and NumPy for data manipulation. It also imports the `Crawler` class from an external module.

#### Creating an Instance of the 'Crawler' Class

In this block, an instance of the `Crawler` class is created. The `Crawler` class handles the retrieval of NHL game data.

#### Defining the `Panel` Class

The `Panel` class is introduced to manage the graphical user interface for data selection and display. The following functionalities are implemented:

- **Season Selection:** You can select your desired season among all available seasons automatically specified by the `crawler`. The season is also updated based on the entered game ID.

- **Game Type Selection:** You can select your desired game type between regular and playoff games. The game type is also updated based on the entered game ID.

- **Game ID Selection:** The game ID is adjusted based on the selected season and game type. The only thing you may want to change is the game ID (last 4 digits).

- **'Go' Button:** This button fetches and displays selected game data, allowing you to explore the data interactively.

- **'Show' Button:** This button displays the selected data in a user-friendly format.

- **'Reset' Button:** This button resets the control panel to its default values.

- **Data Selection:** It enables you to select data categories and drill down into the information.


#### Creating an Instance of the `Panel` Class

In this block, an instance of the `Panel` class is created, which initiates the interactive panel in your Jupyter Notebook environment. 

### Example Usage

Open a Jupyter Notebook environment.

- Copy and paste the provided code blocks into separate cells in your notebook.

- Run each code block sequentially.

- Once you run the last code block, the interactive panel will be displayed in your notebook. -->

<h3 id="32-actual-strength-of-players">3.2. Actual strength of players</h3>

<p>One possible way to find the actual strength of the players in each event of a game is to start with 5 on 5 and then adjust the number of players according to the penalties that occur. For example, if a penalty leads to an ejection of a player, the number of players for that team will decrease by one for the duration of the penalty. If an event happens during that time, the actual strength of the players will be the number of players for each team after accounting for the penalties. Similarly, if another penalty occurs while a previous penalty is still in effect, the number of players will decrease accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="33-additional-features">3.3. Additional features</h3>

<p><strong>Attacking side</strong>: We can find the home team from the following sequence of dictionaries: linescore -&gt; teams -&gt; home -&gt; team -&gt; name  We also have the period number for each event. Moreover, we can find all the periods in liveData -&gt; linescore -&gt; periods. Now, to find the attacking side for a specific event, we have to find the related period and check the rink side for the home team and the away team. Since we already know whether the home team or the away team was responsible for the event, we can find the attacking side based on the rink side.</p>

<p><strong>Shot distance</strong>: We can find the distance of a shot based on the coordinates of the shot and the coordinates of the net. The coordinates of the net depend on the attacking side, which we have it already.</p>

<p><strong>Number of players</strong>: To find the actual strength of the players in each event of a game, we have to keep track of the number of players for each team. As we explained in the “Actual strength of players” section, we can start with 5 on 5 and then adjust the number of players according to the penalties that occur. If a penalty leads to an ejection of a player, we decrease the number of players for that team by one for the duration of the penalty. When an event happens, we can compare the time of the event and the time of the last penalty and see if the number of players should be changed accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="4-simple-visualizations">4. Simple Visualizations</h2>

<h3 id="41-comparing-shot-types">4.1. Comparing Shot Types</h3>

<p>I chose the 2016 season (including both the regular season and playoffs) to produce a figure that compares shot types across all teams. In analyzing the data, it becomes clear that the most dangerous type of shot is the <strong>“deflected shot”</strong>, with the highest goal percentage of <strong>19.8%</strong>. This suggests that deflected shots have a significantly higher chance of resulting in a goal compared to other shot types.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the most common type of shot is the <strong>“wrist shot”</strong>, as indicated by the highest bar in the histogram. The reason I chose this figure is that it provides a straightforward visual representation of the shot and goal counts for each shot type, allowing us to easily compare their quantities and ratios. It’s a valuable tool for understanding which shot types are both frequent and effective in scoring goals.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/Simple_Visualizations/Q5-1_shot_type_histogram.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="42-relationship-between-shot-distance-and-goal-chance">4.2. Relationship between Shot Distance and Goal Chance</h3>

<p>In ice hockey matches, it is generally observed that the <strong>closer the shot distance to the goal, the higher the probability of scoring</strong>. This is because when a player is closer to the goal, the goalkeeper’s defensive range is reduced, increasing the chances of successfully putting the puck into the net. It is clear that the scoring probability is significantly higher for shot distances less than 70 feet when compared to shot distances greater than 70 feet. This trend remained consistent across the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. I opted for a line plot graph as it provides a direct visualization of how the likelihood of scoring changes with varying shot distances.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/Simple_Visualizations/Q5-2_shot_distance_vs_goal_chance_2018.png" alt="" />
<img src="/Images/Simple_Visualizations/Q5-2_shot_distance_vs_goal_chance_2019.png" alt="" />
<img src="/Images/Simple_Visualizations/Q5-2_shot_distance_vs_goal_chance_2020.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="43-goal-percentage-by-shot-distance-and-type">4.3. Goal Percentage by Shot Distance and Type</h3>

<p>In this analysis, I utilized data from the year 2016, including both regular season and playoff games. The figure reveals that there isn’t a single shot type that stands out as the most dangerous across all shot distances. Instead, each shot type has its own optimal goal-scoring range.</p>

<p>It’s evident that when the shot distance is less than 10 feet, the “wrap-around” shot type appears to be the most dangerous, as it boasts the highest average goal-scoring probability in that range. In the 10 to 20 feet distance range, “Tip-in” or “Deflected” shots are preferable choices. When the shot distance extends to the 20 to 40 feet range, “Snap Shot” becomes a more effective option. For distances greater than 40 feet but less than 70 feet, “Slap Shot” appears to be a favorable choice. However, when the shot distance exceeds 70 feet, the goal-scoring probability for all shot types decreases significantly.</p>

<p>The shot map visualization are stored <a href="/Images/Advanced_visualization/shot_map_visualization.html">here</a></p>

<h3 id="52-discusss-from-shot-map">5.2. Discusss from shot map</h3>
<p>The main idea here is to measure the frequency of shots from specific positions for each team compared to the league average. This measure helps highlight areas where a team may be particularly strong or weak compared to the average league.</p>

<p>For example, if Team A has a higher shot rate in front of the net, it suggests that Team A is likely to take shots at close range compared to the average league.</p>

<h3 id="53-discuss-about-the-team-colorado-avalanche">5.3. Discuss about the team <em>Colorado Avalanche</em></h3>
<p>In season 2016-2017, the Colorado Avalanche had dark blue in front of the net, which means that this team took fewer shots compared to the average league. We can assume that the forwards of this team are bad at the shot. As a result, this team final at the lowest ranking of the league.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/Advanced_visualization/2016/Colorado%20Avalanche.jpg" alt="" title="Shot map of Colorado Avalanche in season 2016-2017" width="500px" /></p>

<p>In season 2020-2021, the Colorado Avalanche have a dark red in the middle of the offensive zone, which mean that this team takes a lot of shot. In other words, the forwards of this team are good at controlling the match and shot. Finally, this team takes the highest position in the standings.</p>

<p><img src="/Images/Advanced_visualization/2020/Colorado%20Avalanche.jpg" alt="" title="Shot map of Colorado Avalanche in season 2020-2021" width="500px" /></p>

<p>The analysis and final results make sense.</p>

<h3 id="54-comparision-between-buffalo-sabres-and-tampa-bay-lightning">5.4. Comparision between <em>Buffalo Sabres</em> and <em>Tampa Bay Lightning</em></h3>
<p>Buffalo Sabres:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>From the 2018-2020 seasons, this team had a dark blue area in front of the net. This means that this team can not approach the opponent’s goal and take a shot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Although the Buffalo Sabres have some dark red area in the map (in the year 2018-2019), it is far from the net. It is a long-range shot, which is not really an effective strategy.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/Images/Advanced_visualization/2018/Buffalo%20Sabres.jpg" alt="" width="500px" /></p>

<p><img src="/Images/Advanced_visualization/2019/Buffalo%20Sabres.jpg" alt="" width="500px" /></p>

<p><img src="/Images/Advanced_visualization/2020/Buffalo%20Sabres.jpg" alt="" width="500px" /></p>

<p>Tampa Bay Lightning:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This team had a dark red area in front of the net during 2018-2020. This means that this team control the match and take a lot of shot to the opponent’s net.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/Images/Advanced_visualization/2018/Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning.jpg" alt="" width="500px" /></p>

<p><img src="/Images/Advanced_visualization/2019/Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning.jpg" alt="" width="500px" /></p>

<p><img src="/Images/Advanced_visualization/2020/Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning.jpg" alt="" width="500px" /></p>

<p>In general, the Tampa Bay Lightning team had a good attacking strategy, which is one of the key points to make this team success during three consecutive seasons.</p>
